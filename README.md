# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Project Overview
We were asked to make a nerual network for becks that detetermend if a aplicant will be successfull or not if funded by Alphabet Soup

# Results
* Could not successfuly reached 75 with each step:
   1. added more nerual networks. Accuracy : .55
   2. edited clasification groups from 500 to 1000. Accuracy .57
   3. added another layer. Accuracy: .56
   
# Summary
Attempt to reach 75 failed. But if the goal was only 75 this shows that nerual network might not have been the machine learning algorythem to go. Testing with other programs such as random forest may be needed.
